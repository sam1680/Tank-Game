 * A more complex implementation of a Slider. Contains four components, outline, bar, dial and mask.
 * Outline is a sprite that acts as the min and max points of the Slider.
 * Bar is the visual display of the bar itself, that will be covered/uncovered by a mask as the dial moves.
 * Dial is a draggable sprite that cannot move outside the min and max points.
 * Mask is a BitmapMask laid over the Bar. As the dial moves so too will the mask to cover/uncover the bar.
 * 
 * To be honest masks are not built for Phaser.GameObjects.Containers from my experience trying this.
 * The moment a mask gets made as a BitmapMask it no longer remains attached to a Container, which causes
 * problems with positioning it properly. Can be sorted easily with a bit of hard coding but I would
 * obviously not recommend it. I will leave this as an example of the basic implementation although
